# MathWiz: The Test Run
by *Visible Softworks*

_**The MathWiz** has yet to go on any noteable adventures. But he still does some pretty cool stuff in his day-to-day goings (He is a wizard after all).  When he heads off to the Blasted Cliffs to do some research and is impeded by an evil mage and legions of shadow clones, what will he do?_

_Well, I'm not telling. You'll have to play the game to find that out._
