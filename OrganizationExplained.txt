The non-code files (mostly json right now) have no comments, so here's a quick rundown on what everything is:
*WITHIN THE ROOT*
-menus.json
	A list of objects that must be spawned in to make a specific menu formation.
-objects.json
	A list of objects that may be spawned in regular gameplay (the player, enemies, etc.). Contains (or, will contain eventually) stuff like hitbox sizes, physics attributes, sprite coordinates, animation instructions, etc.
-Save.json
	Blank ATM but will ultimately store save data (has the player unlocked a specific unlockable, has the player beaten x or y stage, etc.)
-tiles.json
	Information about the tiles that make up the levels (pallates, spritecoordinates, etc.).
*WITHIN THE ASSETS FOLDER*
There is only one image in the folder so far. Eventually, there should be sub-folders that split assets into different categories (images, music, etc.)
*WITHIN THE LEVELDATA FOLDER*
All levels follow the same format, so here's a quick rundown
-layerdepths: the depths that each layer should be rendered at
-tiles,flips,rotates,pallates: each of these is a multi-level array with three layers:
	-layers of tiles to be rendered on top of one another,
		-rows of horizontal tiles, and
			-individual tiles.
The four arrays contain exactly the information you'd expect: the type of tile, the way it's been flipped, the way it's been rotated, and the pallate it's to be rendered with.
-objects: list of objects that should be spawned in the level, and where.
